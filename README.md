#Palette Picker

This should be generalized:

-allow for base palette (NWS in current case) to be inputted by user.
-allow for any picture to be uploaded (possible security concerns)
	- if no image provided, provide base images (a la colorbrewer picker)
-add default palettes (like colorbrewer)
-provide colorblind approximations of your palette
